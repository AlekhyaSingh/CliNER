The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville Nine that day ;
The score stood four to two , with but one inning more to play ,
And then when Cooney died at first , and Barrows did the same ,
A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game .
A straggling few got up to go in deep despair . The rest
Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast ;
They thought , if only Casey could get a whack at that -
They'd put up even money , now , with Casey at the bat .
But Flynn preceded Casey , as did also Jimmy Blake .
And the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake ;
So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat ,
For there semmed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat .
